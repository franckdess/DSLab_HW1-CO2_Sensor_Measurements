# Homework 1

The instructions to setup your copy of the project can be found on the course
web site: https://dslab2019.github.io/labs/week4/.

Open the notebook to find all the questions for this assignment.
There are 3 sections totalling to 60 points, plus 5 bonus points.
You can also find a version on gitlab: https://git-dslab.epfl.ch/dslab2019/homework1/blob/master/Assignment_DataScience_Lab_week4_2019_Questions.ipynb .

Rename the notebook ```Assignment_DataScience_Lab_week4_2019_Solutions.ipynb``` and edit the notebook and Dockerfile to complete the assignment.
Commit and push regularly your changes to gitlab.
The content of your repository at the time of the deadline will be used for
grading your work.
In other words, if you push changes past the deadline, midnight of March 27th, these will NOT be
taken into account.

To open the notebook with jupyter, you can type the following command in
your shell.
```bash
jupyter notebook \
  --NotebookApp.default_url=/notebooks/Assignment_DataScience_Lab_week4_2019_Questions.ipynb
```
